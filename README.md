UX Engineering Code Challenge- Coded by Monica Davidson

This code was written to emulate a photo from http://d3vj7y74cpj7c1.cloudfront.net/01_preview3.jpg
 
Certain icons/pictures were inserted into the code, while most of the text was formatted to reflect what the picture displayed. Certain fonts were taken from Google APIs.

A tooltip was used for the instructions, when the user places their curser over a certain ingredient, the tooltip will show how much of that ingredient is needed.

JQuery was also used. Whenever the user has used an ingredient they have the option to click the checkbox. When the checkbox has been clicked, a black line-through will cross out that ingredient.
